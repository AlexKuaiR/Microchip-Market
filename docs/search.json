The Asia Pacific’s semiconductor demand and initial\npopulation growth was unmatched by any of the other four regions that I\nfocused on; however as we approach modern day, the Asia Pacific’s\npopulation line begins to flatten out. This is not unwarranted; it can\nbe represented by a phenomena that describes how birth rates per year in\nmore developed countries are lower than in developing ones. One part of\nthe reason that the Asia Pacific region appears to be nearing the end of\nthis phenomena could be due to it’s dramatic growth in semiconductor\ndemand relative to the other regions, catapulting it’s economic and\ntechnological status.\n\n\n\n",
